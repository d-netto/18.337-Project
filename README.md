# Global Sensitivity Analysis via Polynomial Chaos Expansions

Final project for 18.337 (Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning) on the use of Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis.

Results can be reproduced by activating/instantiating the environment defined by `Project.toml` and running the files in `/examples`.

All benchmarks in `project_writeup.pdf` were run on a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 machine with 8 GB 1600 MHz memory running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.
